Wealthy men and women, including the king and his high officials, commissioned statues of themselves to erect in temples and their tombs.  This allowed them to benefit from offerings set in front of the statues and essentially live forever.  Throughout their history, the Egyptians also carved statues of prisoners, servants, and deities.  In this class, we will explore a variety of statues from throughout ancient Egyptian history.  How did the Egyptians use statues, and why did they create these objects?  Do the answers to these questions vary for different types of statues?  In considering this, we will discuss manufacturing techniques, materials, subject matter, style, and the relationship between text and image.  However, we will also examine other topics that may at first seem to be less obviously related, including mummies and the process of mummification, religion and magic in ancient Egypt, temples and tombs, and funerary beliefs.  In order for students to directly analyze statues, we will take advantage of Baltimore's museums and visit collections of Egyptian art throughout the semester.",

They wrapped relics in imported silks and housed them in reliquaries comprised of expertly cast and gilt bronze elements, finely set jewels, and colorful enamels; they bound exquisitely painted parchment in covers of carved ivory and engraved gold. Monasteries and cathedrals were multi-media projects par excellence. This course investigates the compound nature of objects and architecture produced during the Middle Ages, across Europe. We will examine diverse processes and conditions of production while pursuing questions of media signification and hierarchies. Contemporary texts will be read (in translation) alongside modern archaeological reports, conservation records, and works of art-historical analysis.

But by the time that documentary is completed, the initial idea has likely gone through a radical and\r\nrigorous exploration. The initial idea may emerge from a sudden thought, a chance encounter. It is the moment when a constellation begins to form. The final driving idea behind a documentary may bear little resemblance to that first thought. We will begin with each of your ideas, perhaps, little more than a vague feeling. The painter, Paul Klee, wrote that \u201cdrawing is taking a line for a walk.\" In this course we will take each of your ideas for a walk, imagining why and how the idea might be realized. The why and the how will involve imaginative thinking, seeking additional ideas that coalesce with that first thought. In this way we begin to assemble the constellation that is your idea. To some degree we are less concerned with the initial idea than the subsequent ideas it suggests. The process may involve archival image research, readings, your own writing, listening to music and sounds, and sometimes, just letting your idea wander off on its own. Our goal is to experience the growth of an idea into an articulated intention. That intention is then expressed through a plan incorporating visual style, sound design, and, if appropriate, text. There is no production requirement for this course. There is no requirement of film or video experience. You are required to bring with you an idea that has found you. The point of all of this is for each of you to engage, on a deep and thoughtful level, with an idea that has asked for your help.",

Public policymaking is, above all, an arena in which policy professionals try to bring systematic evidence and scientific knowledge to bear to diagnose, understand, and solve social problems. At the same time, policymaking also takes place in a political environment, in which strategic and purposive actors contend for power and seek to advance their own goals and realize their own visions about how the world ought to be changed for the better.\r\nThe goals that participants in the policymaking process pursue may take a variety of forms: substantive policy outcomes, of course, but also power, political advancement, or material advantage. The actors who populate the process, moreover, may disagree about the goals they seek and making policy \u2014 especially in democratic political systems \u2014 requires some means of resolving these disagreements. Actors also differ in the resources they have at their disposal to seek their goals \u2014 power, money, organization, for example, but also knowledge and expertise. Finally, policymakers cannot do anything they want in pursuit of their goals. They are constrained by the rules and structures that make up the policymaking system.

How is the universe ordered? Who or what is responsible for it? What place do or should humans occupy within it? How ought we to relate to nonhuman beings and forces? We will read three different responses to such questions and show how they are linked to a particular vision of political life. In the first, the world into which human are born is ordered by gods whose actions often appear inexplicable: Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus, Oedipus the King by Sophocles, and Hippolytus by Euripedes will represent this tragic vision of the cosmos.  In the second, Plato , in Republic  and in Phaedrus, the forces of reason and eros play central and powerful roles. In the third, Augustine of Hippo presents a world designed by a benevolent, omnipotent God who nevertheless has allowed humans a share in their own fate.  We end the course with Nietzsche\u2019s Birth of Tragedy , which offers a perspective on these three visions of the world -- the tragic, the rational, and the faithful -- which will help us evaluate them in the light of contemporary political and ecological concerns.",

These pictures within pictures call our attention to several interesting epistemological questions. For instance, what are images and how do they work? In which context, to what purpose, and by whom are they created and used? How should we study them? This course is designed to find our own answers and formulate further questions from a new and distinctive angle: by examining the appearance of \u201cimages within images\u201d across the East/West divide, and across the time periods ranging from the ancient to the modern era. What kinds of differences, and what kind of similarities, are to be found in the way cultures that are spatially and temporally remote from one another conceived the image? Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s Human Condition dated to 1933, for example, plays the idea with being inside and outside simultaneously, an ambiguity that can also be found in the eighteenth-century portrait of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735-1799) entitled \u201cOne or Two?\u201d In Chinese mythology, multiple stories exist that may be compared to the ancient myth of Pygmalion: a representation of a beautiful woman suddenly becomes animated, acquiring real presence and enters into a relation with a male figure. Discussing such similarities or common ideas behind images from different cultures will help us delve deeper into the questions of how we perceive images and why we create and give meaning to them\r\nThere will be a final paper.",

We will examine the emergence and the formation of various political and social protest movements, such as the Israeli Black Panthers, Israeli feminism and the 2011 Social Justice protest. We will discuss at length the history and the nature of dissent in the military and in relation to Israeli wars and will track changes in these relations. Significant portion of the course will be dedicated to the literary, cinematic and artistic aspects of Israeli dissent and their influence on Israeli discourse. We will explore the nature and role of specific genres and media such as the Israeli satire, Israeli television, newspaper op-ed and the recent emergence of social media.

From Antiquity through the Early Modern period, Melancholia was the predominant form of mental illness, thought to be caused by an imbalance in the bodily humors, resulting in an excess of black bile. The disturbed physiology adversely affected the imagination, which, with memory and intellect, was one of the three functions of the soul. Only gradually did imagination come to be identified with deliberate creativity: from about 1400 to 1800, there were two stereotypical victims of melancholia: male intellectuals and female witches. The disruption of society by witch-hunting was even more radical than the rise of the \"man of genius.\" At stake were definitions of psychology (\"science of the soul\") and reality (whether witches and demons interacted \"in the body\" or only \"in the imagination\").

You would just know the way because the map of your neighborhood is stored in your brain. But where in your brain? And how can your neurons conjure up a map? In this course we will examine common themes and disparate insights that different disciplines have produced in the pursuit of these questions. Cognitive and behavioral studies across many species have inferred external and internal factors determining a mental \u201ccognitive\u201d map, what type of spatial knowledge it is likely to comprise, and how it is used by the organism. Moreover, the discovery of different classes of spatially modulated neurons in the mammalian brain has illuminated components of the neural architecture of the cognitive map and was recognized by the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Finally, progress in autonomous robot navigation has yielded lovely technological products (Roomba, or the promise of self-driving cars!), but also unique insights into the computational nature of self-localization and map learning. By the end of this course, you will have developed a critical appreciation of the multi-disciplinary inroads made into one of the most fascinating case studies for understanding the physical basis of cognition.",

With the binary gender system thus perhaps nearing its end, we might wonder if it had a beginning. In fact, the idea that there are two sexes and that they not only assume different roles in society but also exhibit different character traits, has emerged historically around 1800. Early German Romanticism played a seminal role in the making of modern gender and sexuality. For the first time, woman was considered not a lesser version of man, but a different being with a value of her own. The idea of gender complementation emerged, and this idea, in turn, put more pressure than ever on heterosexuality.

The Anthropocene refers to the era in which \"human\" activity becomes a force of \"nature\"\u2013when the impact of human activity on natural processes manifests itself in the stuff of the Earth. For many of us, these planetary transformations are hardly noticeable in day-to-day life, but they are dramatic: we are living through the Earth's sixth mass extinction. What is our relationship to these transformations? Do we have the power to stop them, or at least to minimize their harmful effects? Course readings and films introduce multiple visions of the human/nature relationship and examine the responses they recommend to these and other questions. The political stakes of these visions are brought to light as we consider: How do visions of the human/nature relationship shape and texture core political concepts like freedom, agency, responsibility, and progress? What do they suggest about the strategies most likely to motivate action amid the uncertainty of the Anthropocene? How do these visions subtly (and not so subtly) relegate some to the realm of \"nature\" so that others can be classified as \"human\"?",

We will review the competing discourses about the impact of colonial dominations in these areas from the 1800s to the present-day. In the beginning of the era, the British built up the economic linkage between Hong Kong and Penang, Malacca as well as Singapore to sustain its dominance throughout the \u201cFar East.\u201d In the middle of the period, the expanding Japanese empire developed Taiwan as a footstep to compete with the British interests in South China and Southeast Asia. Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, especially Singapore, became the contested terrain where two colonial powers vied for their influences in the region. The competition was not only about trade, but about the construction of a new East Asian regional order after the end of the Chinese hegemony. In the end of the period, the intervention of the US power in postwar Asia facilitated the retreat of the colonial establishments, British and Japanese ones included. The course that compares the colonial establishments and discourses on colonial legacies among the three areas points out that colonialism constituted an inalienable part of Asian history.

Who if anyone should bear more of the burden of mitigating climate change--rich countries or individuals, those more historically responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, those who currently emit the most, or some other group?  What level of global average temperature increase is too much? What about the commonly accepted threshold of 2 degrees Celsius? Should we be willing to accept more? Less? In any case why? And why is it exactly that we should do something to address the threat? Is it only because we owe it to future generations and the global poor, or are our obligations broader, extending also to non-human entities, like the species that stand to go extinct and the ecosystems that stand to be destroyed?  Although these and other ethical questions have figured less prominently in public debate and discussions by policymakers in recent years, they are no less important than scientific and technological ones.

We begin with Ibn Khaldun, Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, Max Weber, \u00c9mile Durkheim, and Mary Douglas, asking basic questions: What are religion and the sacred? Why do they exist? What is the relationship between religion and social structure? And what role does religion play in morality, solidarity, boundaries, exploitation, patriarchy, and macrohistorical transformations such as the rise of capitalism?\r\n       Keeping this theoretical grounding (and its flaws and biases) in mind, we continue to probe the problem of religion in modernity through more-recent writings. Topics include the secularization debate (Are modernity and religion antithetical?); \u201creligious markets\u201d and rational-choice theories of religion; religious revivalism, evangelicalism, fundamentalism, and proselytizing movements; feminist and queer sociologies of religion; civil religion (Is standing for the national anthem a religious act?); embodiment and prayer; Orientalism and postcolonial interrogations of the secular; religious violence and nationalism; the intersectionality of religion with race, class, and caste; and religion and neoliberalism.

Its definition covers a wide spectrum of analytic and information technology topics, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistical modeling, and efficient database development. This course will review these broad topics, and cover specific analytic and modeling techniques such as advanced data visualization, decision trees, neural networks, nearest neighbor, clustering, logistic regression, and association rules. Although some of the mathematics underlying these techniques will be discussed, our focus will be on the application of the techniques to real data and the interpretation of results. Because use of the computer is extremely important when \u201cmining\u201d large amounts of data, we will make substantial use of data mining software tools to learn the techniques and analyze datasets.

Among the most pressing issues of Romantic poetry were those related to representing, speaking for and speaking to an imaginary creature called The People, not wholly commensurate with that other imaginary creature, The Nation or its Citizens. So for instance, the Ballad revival of the period brought into print the ancient songs of \u201cthe folk,\u201d but the movement was riddled with fakes and forgeries. Rising literacy inspired working class poets, women and ethnic minorities to reshape the English language through poetry. Yet at the same moment, literary gentlemen began to produce their own version of a marginalized and dispossessed \u201cpeople.\u201d All these efforts can be set against a State effort to introduce the first national census, to account for all subjects of the crown.

From the Biblical exodus from Egypt through the beginnings of the diaspora under the Romans to the massive European Jewish immigration to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the founding of the state of Israel, the migrations of Jews have also had a major place in Jewish literature.  Going all the way back to the Bible, but focusing on the 20th century, this course will explore the ways in which literature represents the experience of migration, whether negative (compelled by expulsion or violence); positive (lured by economic or social opportunity); or somewhere in-between.  We will examine poetry, plays, and prose in Yiddish, German, Hebrew, and English (all in translation) on aspects of Jewish migration including the social and political (moving from the countryside to the shtetl (town) to the city; emigration from Central and Eastern Europe to the Americas and to Palestine and Israel; issues of adaptation and assimilation; minority rights) and the literary (what is the relationship of old and new or major and minor languages and literatures?; what is the place of tradition and heritage in a diasporic context?).

Its earliest urban centers appeared by 3500 BCE in the region of modern-day Iraq, Iran, and Syria. Along with urbanism came the emergence of temples and palaces as large-scale elite institutions (along with written records). Their arts manifest some of the earliest complex representations and follow a vibrant course for several millennia. The first empires marshaled large armies and amassed fabulous riches. Complex religious and ritual ideologies were expressed in the art and architecture. And all has been revealed by the archaeologist\u2019s spade. This class explores the art and architecture of Mesopotamia (ancient Sumer, Babylonia and Assyria) from 3500 to 330 BCE.

Nevertheless there are key differences with the authors examined in this course: D.H. Lawrence, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston, and Claude McKay. Whereas railroads united countries, and factories reorganized cities, the disruptions of the early twentieth century affected the entire planet. The telegraph and telephone, steam ships and airplanes knitted nations into a global network. In response, writers worked to register the local effects of these global events, translating planetary change into concrete examples of people adapting to a transforming landscape. In this course, we will reflect on the specific ways that humans influence the environment \u2013 how people bend the land to their will in light of specific historical conditions \u2013 and more important, how nature responds to those forces.
