As an exploration in intellectual history, we will attempt to understand the social world of the Seljuk Turks through political, religious, and literary texts. We will first read a political treatise, Siyasatnama (The Book of Government), written by Nizam al-Mulk (1018-1092), the formidable minister of the Seljuk Empire, who oversaw the reign of three successive sultans during the second half of the eleventh century and created a strong bureaucratic state for the Seljuks. During his administration, he commissioned the development of madrasas, colleges dedicated to the teaching of Islamic law, theology, literature, and history. The most famous of these madrasas was the Baghdad Nizamiyya where Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) taught from 1190 and 1194. We will read Al-Ghazali\u2019s Deliverance from Error in order to explore the state of religious learning at the peak of the Islamic Golden Age. Having discussed the political and religious foundations of Islamic orthodoxy in the eleventh century, next we turn to the rise of heterodox movements that challenged the authority of the Seljuk state. We will briefly examine the history of the Ismaili branch of Shia Islam, focusing on the politico-religious ideas of its most potent representative, Hassan-i Sabbah (1050s-1124). Finally, we will end our class with the Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyam (1048-1131), the prominent poet and polymath of the eleventh century.",

More recent developments are presented, including ridge regression. Generalized linear models follow, emphasizing logistic regression and including models for polytomous data. Variable subsetting is addressed through stepwise procedures and the LASSO. Supervised machine learning topics include the basic concepts of boosting and bagging and several techniques: Decision Trees, Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forests, Conditional Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.

While each student\u2019s research will be focused on one particular issue, everyone will be expected to be generally conversant with the range of topics being researched.   Upon returning from Vietnam, participants will turn their research reports into a final paper (around 20 pages).  The seminar will meet toward the end of the semester to present and discuss the final papers.  Grades will be awarded on the basis of the quality of the research report, the final paper and participation in the seminar and trip to Vietnam.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bebp5s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

It is intended for upper-level undergraduate      students interested in bioethics, migration, public health, and political philosophy. The first part of the course acquaints students with the various types of migrants and relevant political theory,        including citizenship, freedom of movement, open/closed borders, and human rights. In the second part of the course, students discuss different ethical/philosophical concepts related to migration and apply them in analysis of a wide variety of public health and health policy cases. The course culminates with a final paper that students workshop collaboratively. This course challenges students to draw connections between ethical theory and real-world events and policies involving human migration. This is a Gordis Teaching Fellowship course.",

        "description": "This is a course on lyric theory in the Renaissance and as such is a good introduction to early modern literary study.  We will take up the early modern form of the sonnet as a test case for the interaction between vernacularity and globalization.  We will consider early modern topics including \u201cinvention,\u201d \u201cimitation,\u201d and rhetoric, as well as explore formal concerns that are intertwined with political, social, cultural and economic experiences of early modernity.  Along with the consideration of the emergence of literatures in new languages and nationalist differentiation, we will also consider mechanization (whether in print or literary trope) that produced both early modern literature and political life in an international system.  We will consider such topics as sequence; modes of address; vernacularity and linguistic nationalism; the themes of love v. empire; the social role of the sonnet; the nature and materiality of writing; patronage and circulation; the question of private, occasional, and public poetry; the place of sonnets in manuscript collections; the histories of books; poetic subjectivity and objective thought; and we will also read a good many sonnets, largely in English, through close attention to language, media and transmission histories.  Some contemporary literary theory on the sonnet will be introduced, as well as sonnets in European languages other than English, depending on the students\u2019 interests and proclivities.  Students will be expected to work in the manuscript and print collections of the Bodleian library to prepare a class report on their chosen topics.  The class puts the sonnet in relation to other forms in Renaissance literature and thus should serve as a good survey of the period and its issues.",

Primary news reports, articles from content aggregators, and social media postings are constantly feeding us information, and we must somehow synthesize all of this information in order to arrive at sensible conclusions. This course is designed to introduce students to the considerations that researchers and analysts face when performing the studies that make up the core content of news reports. In particular, students will take a detailed look at the complex process of going from scientific question to data analysis to journal publication to mainstream media reports. Using readings from news sources and primary research, students will engage in discussions about the considerations and complications that arise at each stage. Additionally, students will gain exposure to the computational aspect of statistics through data analysis and simulation exercises in the R programming environment. \r\nThis is a Gordis Teaching Fellowship course.\r\nJuniors/Seniors Only",

Pluralists generally analyze politics in terms of struggles for power between groups motivated by a range of differences including class interests, national, racial, gender, ethnic, or sexual identities, and religious beliefs. While many tend to think of the economy as a matter for technical management based on calculations of rational interests and impersonal market forces, recent scholarship in a number of fields seeks to politicize and pluralize economic questions, bringing up issues of gender, race and religion in the functioning of markets, for instance through a focus on the power \r\ndynamics of credit and debt. In this course we will explore the theoretical roots of pluralism, draw on this foundation to analyze power relationships of identity and difference at work in the political \r\neconomy of capitalism both past and present, and consider the implications of this analysis for contemporary understandings of democracy and democratic activism.\r\n\r\nThis course will be taught through extensive classroom discussion, student-led presentations of assigned readings, short papers, and will include at least one guest lecture by an invited speaker.\r\n Readings will include works by William James, Robert Dahl, Max Weber, Michel Foucault, William Connolly, Marieke De Goede, Saidiya Hartman, Eddie Glaude, Jr. and Miranda Joseph.",

Components of a strong health system include a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately paid workforce; reliable information on which to base decisions and policies; and well-maintained facilities and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies. However, many countries in the developing world have weak health systems, badly in need of strengthening and reform. This course offers a practical introduction to major issues, policies and practices related to health systems and health policy in a developing country context. The course combines two perspectives.  First, students will apply principles related to health systems strengthening and reform to develop a framework to strengthen and rebuild health systems in fragile states.  Second, students will learn about and apply key insights from economics to understand health behaviors and health care markets, and to inform the design of health policy in low and middle-income countries. Students are expected to be comfortable reading articles that evaluate health system interventions as well as applied economics papers and think through the logic and implications of economic theory (without complicated statistics or math).  Substantive preparation and class participation are expected.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bebp5s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

Despite these claims, it was only after the Civil War, with the Reconstruction Amendments (1865-1870), that the language of equality made its way into the U.S. Constitution. Even as Africans Americans gained the promise of equality before the law by 1870, Jim Crow laws persisted well into the 20th century, while women did not win the long fight for suffrage until 1920. This course will consider how American writers between 1865 and 1920 consciously or unconsciously re-wrote Tocqueville\u2019s analysis of democracy in America to account for the opening up of political equality to once-excluded groups as well as the undemocratic realities that many people experienced in their everyday lives (in the form of discrimination, deepening class divisions, and gender inequality). Reading novels, poems, autobiographies and travel narratives from this era, we will explore the extent to which democratic reform registers in lives of everyday individuals, with an eye for those moments when state-level changes are reflected or, more commonly, come up short in practice.",

Companies produce consumer goods, provide vital infrastructure, (clean) energy, enable access to finance, and, most importantly, offer employment. This course aims to broaden students\u2019 perspective on development and take a critical look at the social and environmental contribution of large private sector companies in Latin America and the Caribbean (or Latin American companies investing globally). Private sector participation in the extractive industries, agribusiness, manufacturing, and (renewable) infrastructure can do both harm and good. Companies invest in social impact for business reasons, because of international labor, social and environmental risks and related standards (safeguards), or because they see the need to invest sustainably in the communities where they operate. In this six-week, two-credit course, students will learn to critically analyze the risks and opportunities of private sector engagement in development, both through class lectures and from private sector guest speakers. Different methodologies used in corporate reporting and impact measurement will also be covered. As the main course output, students will choose a project case of an existing large corporate investment in Latin America and the Caribbean (or LAC global investment) and assess in a group assignment its social and/or environmental footprint reaching beyond Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bebp5s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

Some of the ways in which this is being explored include: drugs are being developed hand-in-hand with the tests needed to determine whether or not they will be effective; tumor fragments excised from patients are being cultured in the lab for high-throughput testing of drugs and drug combinations; data-rich assays such as genomics and proteomics identify thousands of potentially significant differences between individuals; and computational models are being used to predict which therapies will work for which patients. This course will focus on the applications of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to simulating the effects of various drugs across a heterogeneous population of diseased individuals. Such computational approaches are needed to harness and leverage the vast amounts of data and provide insight into the key differences that determine drug responsiveness. These approaches can also explore the temporal dynamics of disease and treatment, and enable the modification of treatment during recovery.\r\n\r\nRecommended background: 110.201 Linear Algebra, 110.302 Differential Equations, and 550.311 Probability and Statistics (or equivalent).",

While in his early writings he is inspired by life sciences and mathematics, in his later writings Bion shifts away from the scientific view to an aesthetic/mystical vertex, drawing on poets mystics and philosophers, such as Keats, Milton, Shakespeare, Sophocles, Meister Eckhart, St John of the Cross, Plato, Hume and Kant.",

Africa is an increasingly important market in the global economy -- presenting new and growing trade and investment opportunities for business from around the globe -- including the US, Europe, China, India, Brazil, and many others.  The region has also become a rapidly growing destination for foreign direct invest (FDI), with nearly $80 billion a year in private investment flows which substantially exceeds foreign aid, and the highest rate of return on FDI of any developing region.  Beyond the natural resource and primary commodities exports that have fueled African economic growth historically, Africa's growth is currently more widespread across sectors including wholesale and retail trade, transportation, telecom, and manufacturing. This course will examine factually what is happening in Africa that is capturing the attention of policymakers, businesses, and prompting numerous studies and reports on Africa as an emerging market in the global economy.  It will also explore and discuss policy options for governments and companies regarding future engagement with the nations of Africa.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sais-jhu.edu/resources/administrative-offices/how-access-course-syllabi-and-evaluations\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

Aesthetics emerged in the eighteenth century as a theory of such experiences, and among them especially of the beautiful and the sublime. It soon became increasingly concerned with questions regarding the significance of art as a privileged realm of human production and experience. In the German-language intellectual lineage that begins with Kant, aesthetics moved from the margins of theoretical attention to its very center, where it could engage with some of the most pressing dilemmas of modernity. We read excerpts from relevant theoretical texts (Kant, Schiller, the early Romantics, Hegel) as well as texts that perform model cases of aesthetic reflection in relation to concrete works of art (Lessing, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Adorno).",

A focus on the cultural icon Clint Eastwood enables a close examination of American cinematic fantasies of the frontier, frontier violence and the desire to escape or erase the tensions of race and slavery that have deeply permeated the American cultural consciousness, particularly the creation of American masculine ideals.  The course will also take decided note of the national shift from liberal \u201cGreat Society Programs\u201d of the 1960s to the conservative \u201cneoliberal\u201d social and cultural ideals in the 1980s and 1990s.  Our purpose is to consider the organization and reformation of hegemonic power by way of the complex morality play the western film evokes, typically considering the interstitial geographies between civilization and savagery, belonging and alienation, and metropolitan and colonial outpost.  We will privilege in our discussions the contested frontiers of racial dominion. The curriculum is complicated by several significant points of departure from the traditional category of the Hollywood-based American western: a film to frame the question of colonialism and resistance, as well as examples of black cinematic efforts re-drawing boundaries of the racial frontier.

        "description": "The eighteenth century saw the Ottoman capital of Istanbul transformed by the introduction of a brand-new style of architecture that scholars have dubbed the Ottoman Baroque. Informed, as its name suggests, by Western European models, this new manner of building heralded a permanent shift in late Ottoman visual culture that has been reductively discussed as decadent \u201cWesternization.\u201d This seminar will challenge the conventional wisdom and reconsider the Ottoman Baroque as a timely and sophisticated artistic statement by which the empire reaffirmed its global standing in terms that were both locally rooted and internationally resonant. Topics to be addressed include the semiotics of style; the roles and relationships of patrons, artists, and viewers; architecture as a locus of ceremonial and spectacle; and cross-cultural connections and networks. Although focusing on the architecture of eighteenth-century Istanbul, the seminar will extend into other regions and art forms that demonstrate the impact of the Ottoman Baroque, and it will also consider the style\u2019s afterlife in the context of nineteenth-century Ottoman modernity.",

There have been mounting astrophysical evidence that black holes do exist in nature.  Thus they are not just pathologies of the theory but fundamental objects in gravity that require understanding.  Theoretically, they serve as \"laboratories\" for studies in quantum gravity; indeed, most of the research in the field aims to resolve various paradoxes and puzzles that emerge when one tries to understand physics inside or outside black holes.  The goal of this course is to elucidate these paradoxes and puzzles.  First, we will study the classical properties of black holes in general relativity such as horizons, causal history, singularity theorems, area theorems and black hole mining.  Next, we will study semi-quantum and quantum properties such as black hole thermodynamics, Hawking radiation, black hole evaporation.  We will also explore modern results and perspectives on the fundamental physics of black holes that are necessary for current research.

However, for all the compelling reasons to increase the share of energy generated from renewable sources, the development of renewable energy sectors has varied widely across countries. In some economies, more than 30 percent of electricity are now generated from renewable sources, while others have made few attempts to establish domestic renewable energy sectors. This course will examine what's driving the remarkable growth in some countries while others lag behind.  To understand such variation, this course provides an in-depth look at the policies and economics of renewable energy \u2013 from large scale wind and solar to distributed generation (DG) resources such as rooftop solar, micro-grids, and storage in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Weekly, discussion-intensive class meetings examine how specific national and state policies are driving growth in renewable energy sectors, how these policies impact renewable energy projects (large and small scale), how and why these policies have differed across nations and over time, and what factors have contributed to policy failure.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2h1Uieh\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see a video introduction for the course.</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bebp5s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

We begin with an overview of the legacy of Get\u00falio Vargas (1930-45) and the construction of Bras\u00edlia (1961), examining the formation of ideas about Brazilian identity, development and modernization of the country. We then examine the dictatorship (1964-1985), its economic and social project, the place of human rights and its impact on Brazilian society, paying attention to how the people responded to an authoritarian regime through a counter revolutionary movement and through culture (Cinema Novo, MPB/Brazilian popular music, Tropic\u00e1lia) in a fight for democracy. And, finally, we discuss the current issues that the country has dealt with such as of democracy, development, corruption, social mobility, and sporting mega events, for example.

We will examine some of the most pressing issues facing women in contemporary Africa under these broad policy agendas, including poverty, conflict and violence, HIV/AIDS, female genital cutting, and so on. We will open with theoretical perspectives on gender and engage the debates on African feminisms. Next, we will survey historical continuities and discontinuities of colonialism on the gendered dynamics of social structures and institutions. The rest of the course will then engage specific policies, their developmental/underdevelopment implications for women using case studies from the different regions, and the evolving paradigms of gender-development for women on the continent.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bebp5s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

An eminent figure of European intellectual life, deeply versed in the world of the arts and of medicine, Jean Starobinski will guide us through this inquiry.  \r\nWith his seminal work Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Transparency and Obstruction as our focus, we will learn why the ideas of this modern humanist have had such a wide-ranging influence on twentieth-century conceptions of subjectivity, interiority, imagination, and illness (e.g. nostalgia, melancholia, paranoia). We will also learn through his work on Rousseau, why Starobinski\u2019s groundbreaking ideas about writing (l\u2019\u00e9criture) shaped some of the major debates of French theory. \r\n\r\nThis course is taught in English.

        "description": "Non-locality arises when measurement outcomes on space-like separated systems are correlated in such a way that no common cause or super-luminal signaling could possibly account for the pattern of the correlations.  Such happens in quantum mechanics.  Einstein referred to it as \u201cspooky action-at-a-distance.\u201d  Schr\u00f6dinger spoke of the states of the separated quantum systems as \u201centangled.\u201d   Non-locality, rather than the failure of determinism, has come to be regarded as the deeper feature separating quantum from classical physics.  However, whether nature is local or non-local can be defined independently of quantum mechanics, and, in principle, reality could be even more non-local than as described by quantum mechanics.   This seminar will be a gentle introduction to non-locality, as presented in Jeff Bub\u2019s Bananaworld:  Quantum Mechanics for Primates, which presupposes no prior background in quantum theory.  But there is more.  Pondering super-non-local possibilities suggests that the wave-function need not be ontologically fundamental, thus freeing us from the outrageous conclusion that the world branches upon measurement into parallel realities corresponding to spectrum of possible measurement outcomes.  It remains to be seen, however, how one might then avoid lapsing into Quantum Bayesianism, which holds that the wave function  merely represents our subjective degrees of belief about what will happen.",

The role of the state is important, but maritime geography is the center of inquiry in this course.  \r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of seaborne international trade, discovery of undersea mineral resources and increasing value of depleted fish stocks, and emergence of territorial disputes involving maritime spaces has raised the strategic importance of the world\u2019s oceans and seas.

In this course, students will learn why this alternative theory of composition largely failed, and why tonality, in effect, \u201cwon out.\u201d Through in-class demonstrations and discussion, as well as through listening experiences both in and out of class, students will explore some of the reasons why we, as human beings, naturally seek harmonic structure. Important to our discussions throughout the semester will be the harmonic series and the tempered scale. Assigned readings will supplement our continuing discussions of composers who succeeded, others who failed, and why. \r\n\r\nAssignments will include required viewings of Leonard Bernstein\u2019s six-part Norton Lecture Series, \u201cThe Unanswered Question,\u201d recorded in 1973 at Harvard University.

We are not facing a problem that can be resolved through leadership and procedures as much as a crisis that should be well diagnosed, in such a way that the basic concepts of democracy should be reconsidered in the context of the new complex reality that is the European Union. We are probably most in need of a theory of Europe that consists neither of institutional mechanics nor of cosmopolitan haze. And that is precisely the point at which philosophy still has a lot to say. The polarization between theory and practice, \r\nbetween normative and empirical points of view, between disciplines that focus mainly on values and those that happily inhabit functional realities has given way to very diverse controversies in \r\nthe heart of the social and human sciences. This dissociation is as much a problem as a symptom, and we will not succeed at making European reality intelligible if we work without a determined\r\n horizon of valuation or if we maintain a level of exhortative discourse that cares very little for the real game of interests, the weight of our historical past or the multiple determinants that limit \r\npolitical action in a space of dense interdependence. From this perspective, the proposed course will examine questions such as democracy, legitimacy, justice, demos and representation in order\r\n to offer an innovative comprehension about what is new in the European Union and what its main contribution to reconciling democracy and complexity, that is to say to global governance, could \r\nbe.",

The public consumes these images unremittingly and social movements have used these images to highlight the vulnerable character of Black life globally.  However, questions remain as to whether these images work as tools of populist politicization or as sources of entertainment for viewers unsympathetic to the various politics expressed by the Black Lives Matter movement.  This course seeks to explore this uncomfortable reality through the artistic renderings of Kara Walker, an acclaimed mixed media artist whose provocative explorations of race, sexuality, and violence offer one lens by which explore this political phenomenon.  Additionally, students will spend the semester creating multimedia archival projects that explore these images and their political impact on Baltimore.  In doing so, students will explore the politics bound within, pressed upon, and interpreted from the Black body.",

How do we distinguish secondary education from higher learning?  What obligations does the university have vis-\u00e0-vis the state, which often finances it in whole or in part?  What protections does the state owe the university when it pursues research that runs counter to the interests of state?

Ensuring food security for the global population is a grand challenge and one that has many contentious issues. Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. In order for the global population to be food secure, we need functional, sustainable food systems. However, food systems and the political framing of how they function, are complex networks of individuals and institutions. Depending on policies, food systems determine the availability, affordability and nutritional quality of the food supply, and influence the amount and combination of foods that people are willing and able to consume. Agriculture-led economic growth of countries, the health and nutrition of populations, and environmental sustainability of landscapes are all significant factors of how public policies are made and directed. Conflicts regarding land, technology, natural resources, subsidies, inequity and trade are all being played out in the food policy arena. Students who take this course will become familiar with both domestic and international food policy processes and typologies along with the key players in the international landscape, and will be able to critically analyze and debate how policy and science interact with regard to food security. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bebp5s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios</a>",

But in the first of his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes invents a new and puzzling thought experiment.  He imagines an Evil Demon with the power to manipulate the total course of his (Descartes\u2019s) experience, so that what he naturally takes to be experience of the world around him is really a kind of perpetual dream: a simulation or virtual reality, as we might way today.  Descartes\u2019s problem, which has made its way into popular culture through films like those in the \u201cMatrix\u201d series, remains a source of philosophical puzzlement. While no one believes that skeptical hypotheses like Demon or computer deception are true, it is not easy to say how we can exclude them. Given that the deception is systematic, it seems that any \u201cevidence\u201d I cite could itself be part of the simulation. So how do I (or could I) know (for sure) that I\u2019m not the victim of the Deceiver or the Matrix? We shall examine some of the latest attempts to respond to Descartes\u2019s challenge. Does the \u201cHow could I know?\u201d question admit of a theoretical answer, or is the question itself somehow ill-posed? Can we answer it without making significant concessions to skepticism?
